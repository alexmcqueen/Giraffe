Create a Euro millions program.
The program must be able to create a ticket (the ticket) and play it against a set of results (the draw). This set of 
results can stay the same each time or be generated every time you create a ticket, like in real life.

You must be able to play the game until you win the jackpot and count the number of attempts it takes.
You must also count the number of other wins you get during this time.
You must calculate the amount of money it cost to win the lottery.

How Euro millions works:
You pick five numbers between 1 and 50.
You pick 2 lucky stars between 1 and 12.
Each ticket costs Â£2.50.

You can have the following combination of results (from best to worst). Jackpot is getting all 7 numbers:

Matched Numbers         Lucky Stars
5                       2
5                       1
5                       0
4                       2
4                       1
3                       2
4                       0
2                       2
3                       1
3                       0
1                       2
2                       1
2                       0

Things to implement to get this to work.
Create a class which makes a ticket. A ticket is made up of 2 parts; 5 numbers between 1- 50. 2 numbers between 1 - 12.
Create method to generate a random ticket. THis can be used to generate a ticket and a draw as they are the same thing.
Create a method to compare 2 tickets together. Needs to work out what win there was.
